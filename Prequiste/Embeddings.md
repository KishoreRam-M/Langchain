## Embeddings: How LLMs Understand Tokens

### Concept Definition

An embedding is a high-dimensional vector (a list of numbers) that represents a token’s meaning and context. Every token in an LLM is mapped to an embedding, which lets the model “understand” relationships between words, phrases, and even concepts.[^2][^12][^14][^15]

### Why It Matters

Embeddings are the bridge between raw text and neural network math. They let LLMs capture the meaning, similarity, and context of words—so “cat” and “dog” are close together, while “river” is far away.[^12][^15][^2]

### Analogy

Imagine a map where every word is a city. Words with similar meanings are cities close together; unrelated words are far apart. The coordinates of each city are the embedding vector for that word.[^15][^2][^12]

### How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **Tokenization:** Text is split into tokens and mapped to token IDs.[^2][^12][^15]
2. **Embedding Lookup:** Each token ID is mapped to a vector in the embedding matrix (think: a giant table of numbers).[^12][^15][^2]
3. **Contextualization:** The LLM processes these vectors, learning relationships and context to generate or understand text.[^15][^2][^12]

### Code Example (Python, PyTorch)

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Example: 10,000 tokens, each embedding is 300-dimensional
embedding = nn.Embedding(num_embeddings=10000, embedding_dim=300)

# Token IDs for a sentence
token_ids = torch.LongTensor([1, 5, 42, 999])
# Get embeddings
vectors = embedding(token_ids)
print(vectors.shape)  # Output: torch.Size([4, 300])
```


### Line-by-Line Code Explanation

- Create an embedding layer for 10,000 tokens, each with a 300-number vector.
- Prepare a list of token IDs.
- Look up the embeddings for those tokens.
- Print the shape: 4 tokens, each with a 300-dimensional vector.


### Real-World Use Case

- Embeddings power search, recommendations, and semantic similarity (e.g., “find documents similar to this one”).[^14][^12][^15]
- Vector databases (like FAISS, Pinecone) store embeddings for fast retrieval in RAG systems.


### Practice Task

- Try creating embeddings for a list of words and see which are close together.
- Visualize embeddings in 2D (using PCA or t-SNE) to see clusters of similar words.


### Common Mistakes \& Debugging Tips

- Confusing token IDs (integers) with embeddings (vectors).
- Using the wrong embedding size for your model.
- Forgetting to update embeddings during training.


### Best Practices

- Use pre-trained embeddings for common tasks.
- Fine-tune embeddings for specialized domains.
- Normalize or visualize embeddings to check for quality.


### Key Takeaways

- Embeddings turn tokens into vectors that capture meaning and context.[^14][^2][^12][^15]
- They are the foundation for LLMs’ ability to “understand” and generate language.


### Practice Time

- Write code to look up and print embeddings for a few tokens.
- Try clustering embeddings to find similar words.


### Real-World Tip

Understanding embeddings is key to building search, recommendation, and RAG systems with LLMs!
