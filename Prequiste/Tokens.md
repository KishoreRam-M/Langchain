## Tokens \& Tokenization in LLMs

### Concept Definition

Tokenization is the process of breaking text into small pieces called tokens. Tokens can be words, parts of words (subwords), or even single characters. LLMs process and generate text as sequences of these tokens, not as raw text.[^1][^3][^6][^7]

### Why It Matters

Tokenization lets LLMs handle any language, spelling, or even made-up words. It’s also how LLMs count input and output for pricing and context limits—every prompt and response is measured in tokens, not characters or words.[^6][^1]

### Analogy

Think of tokens as puzzle pieces: the model doesn’t see the whole picture (sentence) at once, but works with the pieces (tokens) to build or understand it.[^7][^1]

### Architecture \& Workflow Diagram

```
+-------------------+
|   Input Text      |  <-- "Hello, world!"
+-------------------+
          |
          v
+-------------------+
|  Tokenizer        |  <-- ["Hello", ",", " world", "!"]
+-------------------+
          |
          v
+-------------------+
|  Token IDs        |  <-- [15496, 11, 995, 0]
+-------------------+
          |
          v
+-------------------+
|  LLM Neural Net   |  <-- Processes token IDs
+-------------------+
          |
          v
+-------------------+
|  Output Tokens    |  <-- ["Hi", " there", "!"]
+-------------------+
          |
          v
+-------------------+
|  Output Text      |  <-- "Hi there!"
+-------------------+
```


### How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **Tokenization:** The input text is split into tokens using a tokenizer (often subword-based, like Byte Pair Encoding).[^3][^7]
2. **Token IDs:** Each token is mapped to a unique integer ID.[^6][^7]
3. **Model Processing:** The LLM processes the sequence of token IDs, predicts the next token, and repeats.[^5][^6]
4. **Decoding:** The output token IDs are converted back to text.[^3][^7]

### Code Example (Python, HuggingFace)

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
text = "Hello, world!"
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)
token_ids = tokenizer.encode(text)
print("Tokens:", tokens)
print("Token IDs:", token_ids)
```


### Line-by-Line Code Explanation

- Import a tokenizer from HuggingFace.
- Load the GPT-2 tokenizer.
- Tokenize the text into tokens.
- Encode the text into token IDs.
- Print the tokens and their IDs.


### Real-World Use Case

- LLM APIs (like OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) charge by token, not by word or character.[^1][^6]
- Tokenization allows LLMs to handle typos, rare words, and multiple languages efficiently.[^7]


### Practice Task

- Try tokenizing different sentences and see how many tokens each one uses.
- Change a word or add punctuation and observe how the token count changes.


### Common Mistakes \& Debugging Tips

- Confusing tokens with words—tokens are often smaller than words.
- Exceeding the model’s max token limit (e.g., 4096 for GPT-3.5).
- Not accounting for tokenization when estimating costs or context size.


### Best Practices

- Always check token counts before sending prompts to LLMs.
- Use the model’s official tokenizer for accurate results.
- Pad or truncate token lists to match model requirements.[^4]


### Key Takeaways

- LLMs process text as tokens, not as raw words or characters.[^1][^3][^6][^7]
- Tokenization is essential for model efficiency, flexibility, and cost control.


### Practice Time

- Write code to tokenize and detokenize a sentence.
- Estimate the token count for a paragraph you want to summarize.


### Real-World Tip

Understanding tokenization helps you optimize prompts, control costs, and avoid errors when building LLM-powered apps!
